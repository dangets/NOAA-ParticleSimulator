Map implicit grid coordinates to world lat/lon coordinates (GeographicLib)


Other input/output facilities:
    NetCDF  (wind data)
    grib    (wind data)
    ASCII   particle & wind


More complex advection


Terrain interaction


ParticleSet splitting, sorting


Better OpenGL interface interaction
    placement of concentration sampling
    placment/specification of sources


Multiple particle sources

Particle type specialization
    different logic based on particle type

Figure out linking bug
    for texture wind data there is some clobbering during the make
    can only have advect_original or advect_runge_kutta but not both

Optimizations:
    Avoiding OpenGL copy (manipulate particles directly in OGL buffer)
    Incremental ParticleSet creation

MPI
    parallelize on ParticleSets
