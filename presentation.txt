code organization and brief walkthrough
	- ParticleSet & WindData
	- high level overview of Thrust
	- conversion betweeen host-running and device-running
	- inputs / outputs
		- OpenGL
		- VTK    (show sample VTK video)
		- ASCII
		- grib
	- advection kernel
	- concentration measurements


performance measurements
	- host side
	- device side
	- texture memory


future enhancements
	- map "relative" coordinates to world coordinates
	- particle specialization
	- terrain interaction

	- better user-interface
	- better in-situ interaction
		- camera movement
		- construction of particle sources
		- specification of concentration zones
		- dump to image / video
	- investigate optimizations
		- avoiding OpenGL copy
		- incremental ParticleSet creation

	- MPI capable (parallelize on particles)
