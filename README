Dependencies
    cuda toolkit >= 4.0
        The thrust library was introduced & included in CUDA release 4.0

    GLEW - OpenGL Extension Wrangler (makes working with OpenGL easier)
        libglew1.5
        libglew1.5-dev

    GLFW - library for creating an OpenGL context and basic interaction
        libglfw2
        libglfw-dev

    VTK libraries - Provides functions for dumping particle data to industry standard VTK formatted files
        libvtk5-dev

    GLM - Header-only library that provides vector & matrix math for integration with OpenGL
        http://glm.g-truc.net/
        Not officially packaged by Ubuntu 10.10, but it is a very widely used library.

    json-cpp - Library for parsing JSON formatted data in C++ programs
        http://jsoncpp.sourceforge.net/
        Not officially packaged by Ubuntu 10.10, but for now it is already included in the lib folder.
        If it ever does get packaged by Ubuntu, it should be removed from here and use the standard install.


Notes on running:
    There is a python script for now to generate the ASCII wind data files.
    The script 'genData.py' in the data directory will create some files, and
        the script shouldn't be too complex to read to see what it's doing.
        It is hardcoded as of now to a cylinder output, but there are other outputs available.


How to make a video:
    I used DevIL previously - missing from this version...
    DevIL will dump OpenGL framebuffer to PNG files
    use ffmpeg to make a movie
